# LittleCaesar

This was my attempt at programming a Caesar Cypher in C++. I am not a computer scientist or expert by any means so I imagine it could look prettier. If you have any idea how to improve it or it is helpful in any way please do not hesitate to fork.
It's been a little while since I've worked on this and the idea came from Khan Academy.
